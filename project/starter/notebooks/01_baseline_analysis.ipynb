    "# UdaciMed | Notebook 1: Baseline Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to UdaciMed! You are a **Machine Learning Engineer** tasked with optimizing our chest X-ray pneumonia detection model for production deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The challenge**: Our current model needs to be integrated into a multi-model diagnostic suite to be served to multiple tenants, but its high resource usage prevents efficient deployment on our shared T4 GPU infrastructure. This is the primary blocker to expanding our diagnostic services.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Your mission**: Optimize the model to meet the requirements for our multi-tenant cloud deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Optimization goals**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to transform the baseline model to increase concurrent instances per model by meeting these production targets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **>80% FLOP reduction**: Floating Point Operations determine computational cost - reducing FLOPs directly improves throughput and energy efficiency for high-volume medical screening workflows.\n",
    "- **< 100MB peak memory footprint**: Total GPU memory consumption (parameters + activations + workspace) during inference - the primary constraint for multi-tenant deployment where multiple model instances share GPU resources.\n",
    "- **< 3ms latency**: This ensures a real-time user experience. We will measure both *amortized latency* (average time per sample in a large batch) and *true latency* (time for a single-image inference), as both are important for different use cases. This is critical for emergency medical scenarios where immediate pneumonia detection can be life-saving.\n",
    "- **> 2000 samples/second throughput**: This target ensures the service is cost-effective and can handle high request volumes, which is essential for a scalable multi-tenant setup.\n",
    "- **> 98% sensitivity***: This is a non-negotiable clinical safety requirement. We must ensure that a threshold percentage of all true pneumonia cases are correctly identified. All optimizations must be validated against this metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this notebook, you will build the foundation for our optimization strategy by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Establishing baseline performance** with comprehensive profiling.\n",
    "2.  **Analyzing the primary bottlenecks**, distinguishing between compute, parameter memory, and activation memory.\n",
    "3.  **Identifying optimization opportunities** in both the model architecture and the deployment configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Let's set up an optimization vision for UdaciMed's next-generation diagnostic platform!**\n"
